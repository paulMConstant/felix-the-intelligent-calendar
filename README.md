# felix-the-intelligent-calendar
A planning utility tool, to generate highly-constrained schedules. Powered by Rust and GTK.

Display and modify schedules on a GUI (GTK3), export them as PDFs.
Can be deployed on Linux, MacOS, Windows (Windows can be a pain because of GTK).

Currently rewriting it with a CQRS architecture and Dioxus, under the name "Felicie".
